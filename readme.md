# About
**A mod that increases the difficulty of the game by adding a bunch of challenges, while trying to stay compatible with everything.**

The challenges are separated into multiple modules to make them separateable (where possible). Feel free to adapt the code for your own use.

# Changelog
## Version 0: Development of Elitist difficulty
* #### 0.3: Death by failing saving throw
    * It's as simple as checking the dangergrasp time
* #### 0.0 ~ 0.2: Before README

    * And two challenges: electrodeath and death by falling.
